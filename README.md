# ðŸ”§ LTspice Analog Experiments

Welcome to my self-learning repo for analog circuit simulations using LTspice!

A collection of personal LTspice experiments to explore and apply analog electronics.

## ðŸ§  Why create this?
This repository is my personal playground for exploring analog electronics through LTspice simulations.

I spend a little time every day diving into circuits â€” not as part of coursework, but simply because I enjoy learning how things work. This space reflects that habit, that curiosity, and my commitment to understanding electronics one experiment at a time.

Every circuit here is built in my free time, just out of interest â€” and I document it to stay accountable, track my growth, and hopefully inspire others to explore too.

**Disclaimer**: This is not coursework  it's my own exploration and curiosity into electronics.

## ðŸ’¡ Why LTspice?
LTspice is a fast, simple and free circuit simulator. 
It lets me quickly simulate real analog behavior, test ideas, make mistakes, and learn visually.

Linear Technology, Inc. originally designed it 
for engineers to simulate circuits. 
It competes with expensive commercial products like TannerEDA and PSpice. 
Advantages of LTspice are that circuit sizes 
are unlimited, new models can be added, and the user can modify the simulatorâ€™s 
behavior.
